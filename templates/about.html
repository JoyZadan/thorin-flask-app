<h2>About Thorin &amp; Company</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
    to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son of
            Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli.
            Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the
            Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of
            Five Armies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
            the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
            found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
            Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
            Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was a dwarf of Durin's Folk known for being a part of Thorin's Company in the Quest of Erebor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and
            survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot,
            along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            Fellowship of the Ring.
        </p>
        <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the

            of Fundin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied
            Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

            Ori was a member of Thorin's Company of Dwarves and participated in the Quest of Erebor, as well as fighting
            in and surviving the Battle of Five Armies. He, along with his cousins Dori and Nori,[2] were remote kinsmen

        </p>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
            member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the
            quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of
            Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

        <h3>Dori</h3>
        <p>
            Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo
            Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on theQuest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely
            Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
            strongest of the thirteen companions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori.
            In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in
            search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>Nori</h3>
        <p>
            Nori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori,[1] and was a
            remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple, he played the flute, and he was very fond of
            regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them.
            Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in
            Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nori did little to distinguish himself during the Dwarves's adventures in the wild, though he shared the
            same array of experiences as the others of the Company: captured in turn by Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, and
            Elves, they eventually reached the distant Lonely Mountain and recovered it for Durin's Folk.

        <h3>Bifur</h3>
        <p>
            Bifur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being a companion to Bilbo Baggins and Thorin
            Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain, along with his cousins Bofur and Bombur.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
            He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to
            live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Answering Thorin Oakenshield's Quest of Erebor, he went to the meeting at Bag End with his cousins Bofur and
            Bombur. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by Trolls and nearly killed by Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants,
            Great Spiders, and the dragon Smaug himself. A valiant and brave warrior, Bifur never gave up, and fought in the
            Battle of Five Armies. In the fallout of the great battle, Dáin II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure,
            and he retired to live at the Lonely Mountain.

            Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following
            the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their quest to the Lonely
            Mountain as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the
            fattest Dwarf in the company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

        <p id="gandalf">
            "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy
            eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat."
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of
            Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time
            amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda,
            Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to
            Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore
            the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he
            followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those
            who listened to him out of despair.
